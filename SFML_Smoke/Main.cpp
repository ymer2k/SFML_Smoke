        // update function then we would perhaps move the player a very big distance, mahybe through walls etc.

        // Now since we have Fixed Time frames. IF timeSinceLastUpdate is 3x TimePerFrame, we would just update the game three times with that time step
        // and then render the game after that! This way we would not jump huge distances in one "cycle" of game.update()
